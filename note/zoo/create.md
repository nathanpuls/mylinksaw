# CREATE SEARCH PAGE

Follow these steps to create your personalized search page:

1. Sign up for an account at [github.com](https://github.com) (if you donâ€™t already have one).
2. Create a new repository. You can use this link: [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) (Repo must be on branch **"main"** NOT gh-pages).
3. Name the repository **"mylinksaw"**.
4. Click **"Create repository"** (Leave other settings as default).
5. There's a blue area: "Quick setup" where it says "Get started by creating a new file". Click "creating a new file".
6. Name the file **"links.txt"**.
7. Add links in the following format (spaces are allowed, just ensure a colon separates the label from the URL):  
   - Label:URL  
   - Example: **"Google:http://google.com"** (you can skip "http://" if desired).

8. To create a search link, use the **'$'** symbol to represent the search query. For example:  
   - **"Google search:https://www.google.com/search?q=$"**  
   This allows users to type their query after selecting the Google label from the suggestions.

9. For the default links that Linksaw uses [click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanpuls/linksaw/refs/heads/gh-pages/suggestions.txt)
10. After you are done adding links, click "Commit changes" (Changes may take a few minutes to take effect).
11. Visit **YourGithubUsername.linksaw.com** to use your personalized links.
